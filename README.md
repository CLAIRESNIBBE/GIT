Python Code for ML (Warfarin Dosing)
The Code sets out to reconcile the results published in [1] by Innocent Asiimwe et al, with my methods - noting that Asiimwe code in R and I am coding in Python. Both the results applied to an ethnically derived subset of the IWPC data set (690 patients) as well as the War-PATH data set (364 patients) needed to be independently reconciled.
The Code then attempts to find an ML algorithm other than multiple least squares regression (MLSR) to fit the data sets, with lower MAE,MAPE,Bias and higher PWSE and RSquared than those reported in [1].
